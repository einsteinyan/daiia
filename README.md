# DAIIA

Final Project for the DAIIA course.

- `init.ipynb` is a basic implementation of a festival ground with guests moving to the center. We can build other logic using this as template.
- `Test.ipynb` is an example from AgentPy website. 
- `model_alt.py` is a non-interactive version of the AgentPy example.
